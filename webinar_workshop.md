1. Intro to Full Stack Development with AI







2. Basics of AI (Artificial Intelligence)
What is AI?
AI enables machines to mimic human behavior like understanding text, recognizing faces, or making decisions.

Real-Life AI Examples:

Voice Assistants (Siri, Alexa).
Recommendation Systems (Netflix, YouTube).
Chatbots (Customer Support).







3. What is Windsurf (or AI Models)
Explain the purpose of AI Models:

Windsurf isn't a known AI tool, but if you meant an AI framework or tool (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), explain its role:

AI frameworks train models to perform tasks like recognizing images or analyzing text.
Example: Training a model to recognize cats in images.
Mention AI APIs like OpenAI or Google Cloud AI:

They provide pre-trained AI models to developers, making it easier to integrate AI features.







4. How AI Enhances Full Stack Development
Explain how AI fits into full stack applications:

Frontend:

AI can create interactive interfaces (e.g., ChatGPT in websites).
Recommendation widgets (e.g., “You might like this…”).
Backend:

AI processes and analyzes data.
Examples: Predictive analytics, text analysis.
AI APIs:
Demonstrate how APIs like OpenAI GPT or Google Vision can be integrated into full-stack applications.







5. Simple Example Project
Idea: AI-Powered Todo App

Users input tasks, and the app uses AI to classify or analyze them.

Frontend:

Built with React.
Input field for tasks.
Backend:

FastAPI backend processes input using AI.
AI categorizes tasks as "Urgent," "Not Urgent," etc.









6. Live Demo Idea
Prepare a quick demo:

AI Chatbot:
A simple chatbot using React for the frontend and OpenAI API in the backend.
Show how AI provides responses based on user input.





7. Closing and Future Scope
How AI will transform Full Stack Development:
Automation of repetitive tasks.
Better user experience with personalization.
Invite participants to explore AI frameworks and APIs.
Example: Hugging Face, OpenAI, and Google Cloud AI.




Tools You Could Introduce:
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS.
Backend: FastAPI, Flask, Django.
AI APIs: OpenAI, TensorFlow.js, Hugging Face.
Databases: Firebase, MongoDB.
